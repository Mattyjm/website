					<br> This website was made with HTML and CSS. 
					 
					<p> <h3> What is HTML? </h3>
					
					HTML, or also known as Hyper Text Markup Language, is a standard markup language for web page creation. It can be used in conjection with CSS and Javascript.
					It allows the creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web page) such as tags and attributes.
					<br> <br> The most common use cases for HTML is for web developement. Developers are able to use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files.
					
					</p>
					
					<p> <h3> What is CSS? </h3>
					
					CSS, or also known as Cascasding Style Sheets, is a way to specify how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
					
					<br> <br> CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. 
					It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation
					
					</p>
					
					
					<p> <h3> Software used: </h3>
					 I used Notepad++ to edit my HTML and CSS files. Files are then hosted on Github, a free, cloud-based service that allows for software development, as well as version control via Git.

					<p> <h3> HTML code: </h3>

					1. Declare a HTML document with "!DOCTYPE html" for the browser to read and run the page.

					<br> 2. Element "html" is the root element of an HTML page.

					<br> 3. Element "head" contains meta information about the HTML page.

					<br> 4. Element "title" specifies a title for the HTML page (shown in browser's title bar or in the page's tab).

					<br> 5. Element "link" is the relationship that links our HTML and CSS file together.

					<br> 6. Element "body" is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

					<br> 7. The "h1" element defines a large heading. Headings range from h1 to h6.

					</p>

					<p> <h3> CSS code: </h3>
					Example of how CSS codes works would be the first line, body{ }. It is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style).

					<br> We can now style our webpage using various commands. Colour, size, font, layout, and many more can be changed, and is applied sitewide.
